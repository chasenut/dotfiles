## Install
Clone repo
```
git clone git@github.com:Cashtann/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```



You may need to install some software manually (not everything is included here nor in Brewfile):
 - zsh (may be required to run some scripts)
 - tmux
 - vim
 - neovim
 - git
 - vscode
 - build-essentials
 - other stuff I don't remember

## TODO
Make a script that puts every file exactly where it should be and installs some software

Good luck on your new machine!
